# LAOS Ownership Parachain

The LAOS Ownership Parachain is a specialized chain built on Polkadot. 

It offers several functionalities that enable the management and transfer of LAOS native utility tokens, as well as the ownership of all LA (Living Assets) created directly within LAOS. Additionally, the Parachain handles the runtime upgrades and stores state roots of Evolution Chains (Evochains), providing asset attribute certification methods and rewarding Evochain validators upon receiving new correct roots.
